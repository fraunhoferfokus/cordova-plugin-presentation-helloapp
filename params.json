{"name":"HelloApp","tagline":"","body":"# Sample App using the Cordova Presentation API Plugin\r\n\r\nThis sample app bases on the standard cordova sample app and extends it by a\r\nmultiscreen feature using the\r\n[Cordova Presentation API Plugin](http://fraunhoferfokus.github.io/cordova-plugin-presentation).\r\nThe goal of this app is to showcase the capability of the Presentation API that is\r\ndiscussed by the [W3C Second Screen Presentation Working Group](http://www.w3.org/2014/secondscreen/).\r\n\r\n[Comments](https://github.com/fraunhoferfokus/cordova-plugin-presentation-helloapp/issues) and [contribution](https://github.com/fraunhoferfokus/cordova-plugin-presentation-helloapp/pulls) anytime welcome.\r\n\r\n# Screens\r\n\r\nWhen the application launches on the device (currently Android and iOS devices are supported)\r\nthe following screen will be presented, displaying the availability of attached\r\nexternal screens. To make a screen available to the application just attach a AV cable to the device or activate wireless screen mirroring (within the iOS simulator choose e.g. ```Hardware``` -> ```External Display``` -> ```1024 x 768```):\r\n\r\n![Step1](docs/phone1.png)\r\n\r\nWhen the \"Presention Available\" button is clicked the ```navigator.presentation.requestSession(\"receiver.html\");```\r\nAPI call will be issued resulting in a native screen picker view listing\r\nall available attached external screens:\r\n\r\n![Step2](docs/phone2.png)\r\n\r\nMeanwhile on the attached external screen (cable or wireless screen mirroring) the following is displayed:\r\n\r\n![Step3](docs/tv1.png)\r\n\r\nAfter picking the screen form the list the requested document will be rendered on that screen.\r\nThe presentation session will transition into the state ```connected```. Using the session\r\na bi-directional message communication channel is established that is comparable with Web messaging API.\r\nIn this sample app the sender can send a Ping message to the receiver or close the session.\r\nThe sender expects a response (a simple echo) to that Ping message and will increment the Ping counter:\r\n\r\n![Step4](docs/phone3.png)\r\n\r\nUsing the presentation session the receiver will display an incoming Ping message and echo it back.\r\nThe receiver as well can close the session, this will happen in this sample app\r\nif there is no subsequent Ping message within a given time:\r\n\r\n![Step5](docs/tv2.png)\r\n\r\nAfter the presentation session is closed the app transitions into its initial state.\r\n\r\n# Build and run intructions\r\n\r\nCurrently the [Cordova Presentation API Plugin](http://fraunhoferfokus.github.io/cordova-plugin-presentation) supports Android and iOS.\r\n\r\n## iOS instructions\r\n\r\nIt is assumed that you have Xcode installed and have cordova set up\r\nproperly.\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ git clone https://github.com/fraunhoferfokus/cordova-plugin-presentation-helloapp\r\n$ cd cordova-plugin-presentation-helloapp\r\n$ cordova platform add ios\r\n$ cordova plugin add de.fhg.fokus.famium.presentation\r\n$ cordova build ios\r\n$ cordova run ios\r\n```\r\n\r\nNote: alternatively to installing the cordova plugin from the registry, the plugin can be installed by pointing to its repository \r\n\r\n```$ cordova plugin add https://github.com/fraunhoferfokus/cordova-plugin-presentation.git```\r\n\r\n## Android instructions\r\n\r\nIt is assumed that you have Android SDK installed, path to SDK binaries set\r\nand have cordova set up properly.\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ git clone https://github.com/fraunhoferfokus/cordova-plugin-presentation-helloapp\r\n$ cd cordova-plugin-presentation-helloapp\r\n$ cordova platform add android\r\n$ cordova plugin add de.fhg.fokus.famium.presentation\r\n$ cordova build android\r\n$ cordova run android\r\n```\r\n\r\nNote: alternatively to installing the cordova plugin from the registry, the plugin can be installed by pointing to its repository \r\n\r\n```$ cordova plugin add https://github.com/fraunhoferfokus/cordova-plugin-presentation.git```\r\n\r\n# Notice\r\n\r\nThis app is based on the default cordova hello world app. See NOTICE file.\r\n\r\n# License\r\n\r\nCopyright 2014 Fraunhofer FOKUS\r\n\r\nLicensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0 (the \"License\");\r\nyou may not use this file except in compliance with the License.\r\nYou may obtain a copy of the License at\r\n\r\n    http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0\r\n\r\nUnless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, software\r\ndistributed under the License is distributed on an \"AS IS\" BASIS,\r\nWITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied.\r\nSee the License for the specific language governing permissions and\r\nlimitations under the License.\r\n\r\n### Contact\r\n\r\n[Fraunhofer FOKUS - Competence Center FAME // Future Applications and Media](http://www.fokus.fraunhofer.de/en/fame/index.html)\r\n\r\n![.](http://webinos.fokus.fraunhofer.de:3002/piwik/piwik.php?idsite=2&rec=1)","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
